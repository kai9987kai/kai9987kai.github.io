                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">This project had a theme of the new dawn, so my plan was to create a post-apocalyptic game environment. The purpose of this is to create an environment users can walk around in. The aim for the environment is to create a map; the purpose is to create an area that has decrepit buildings that clash with the opposite of flourishing life for an open-world environment.
<br>
<br>To achieve a good product that is of high standard and usable in the industry, I will use 3ds Max and Substance Painter to create high-poly models and high-resolution textures. The concepts I have thought about include scenery of plants growing through cracks and ivy along building walls. The theme will be further built upon by having a sunrise to subconsciously match the theme.
<br>
<br>A key feature to make this project possible is height and normal maps, which will allow for details such as cracks to be possible, which otherwise may not have been possible. As well as this, I am going to use masks in texturing a lot to apply details to select locations. The industry requires models that have no rat's nests or other problems such as overlapping faces, and I will stay vigilant to prevent problems like this. Another thing that will need to be created is background sound as this is a media project, I will need to research what sounds you would hear in a barren area one idea I want to play with is the sound of the wind whistling or the footsteps when the player walks.
<br>
<br>Settling with a hut in the centre of the land as a reminder of a past civilisation allowed me to think of props that would be sprawling an abandoned, left like a ghost town sort of like the decimated towns left after the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. A theme with other post-apocalyptic pieces of media is radiation which I will explore as a back story but however I want to stay away from the overused mutated plants often scene in fantasy works.
<br>
<br>Assets to create:<br>Trees<br>rocks&nbsp;<br>main building<br>grass<br>benches&nbsp;<br>lampposts<br><br>Finally, I will import the models and textures to unity and add a player pod, 3-way lighting and sound effects as well as using the player camera that follows the movement from the unity presents. This stage is where the project will come together and will also be a time where additional ideas can be thought of an added. After completing the base of the project, I plan to return and add more assets.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>

                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>Research</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Throughout this project, I had to complete a large amount of research to push my skills. First, I needed to learn how to create plants. To do this, I learned from several tutorials and retrieved reference images from google. Some of these tutorials have been linked below. Beyond this, I researched what makes an apocalyptic scene successful and found out about how small things such as sound and background create immersion which, if broken, can ruin the experience which has also given me an idea to use the background image to make the land look endless almost like an illusion of a grand area. The topologies of the plants were hard to make and required looking into how real plants looked and other people's models and their wireframes to understand their design.
<br>
<br>Looking into other post-apocalyptic environments helped me develop the idea of plant life beginning to come back to life despite the environment. Games such as Fallout 4 explored this sort of idea to detail. Compared to fallout 4 the scene will be rather basic but will have more symbolism.
<br>
<br>Something I did was research into types of lighting which include Ambient or general lighting Accent lighting and Task lighting, the source for this is linked below also linked below is a link which helped me learn how to make grass on planes and other environmental skills.
<br>
<br>A learning curve in this project where my 3d models we’re getting creases led me to begin to use subdivisions something I previously found daunting and allowed for this problem to go once and for all.
<br>
<br>In addition to this I also sourced wind sounds from online and looped it as background sounds, if I was to make this sound effect in real life I would have had to recorded the sound of the wind from outside or used a fan this would replicate a similar sound but would not quite be the same also an issue with importing sounds from the web is copyright which can lead to legal issues a world around for this is to write a letter to the copyright holder requesting to use the sound, sometimes they may request a royalty per use<br><br>Sources:<br>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">In this project I had to use a wide range of practical skills one such skill used early on was the use of modifiers without which this project would not be possible the building relied on the use of the symmetry modifier which allowed me to build one side of the building and it to be automatically replicated on the other side of the axis. Other Modifiers in 3ds max such as the hair and fur modifier where highly important for the creation of plants. Practically this project required a intense amount of revisiting the original max file to make the required effects come through, a large number of lines had to be chamfered to make them stand out more in conjunction with texting in edge highlights to really show of the 3d structure in a sharp way rather than a smooth clay like wall.
<br>
<br>Another Skill I used was sculpting allowing me to shape a plane into a hilly terrain this was done within 3ds max although if I used specific sculpting software such as Zbrush, I could have done this to make the landscape to a  higher standard with smaller details.
<br>
<br>Moving on to the texturing, UV unwrapping was key and was the main skill I used as well as baking my models and using substance painters vast array of paint brushes and I also took advantage of normal and height maps to add details and decals.
<br>This was all possible due to good time management allowing for time to produce a quality piece of media.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Reflecting on the project I could have made a larger scene and been more ambitious with creative ideas, also some of the texturing could have been made to a higher resolution, the models are good but still could have been more complex in order to push myself.
<br>
<br>
<br>This scene was my first to have landscape and plants and I'm happy with how the 3d models and textures turned out. The project allows for a player to walk round and if I was going to do it again I would add plant physics when you walk through them however, I'm happy with the sounds as you walk through the area.
<br>
<br>
<br>In conclusion the project is a success as I learned many new things but would improve if done again by first of all planning out the scene with rough 3d models to allow for a comprehensive idea of the way the final product should look.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>
