# Implementation Plan - Expanding Project 1X4G Ecosystem

## Goal Description
Implement the remaining features proposed in the "Expanding Project 1X4G" phase. This includes adding a **Consciousness Monitor (Phi Metric)** to the simulation, creating a **Manufacturing Blueprint** for the BPU hardware, drafting a **Security Protocol** for the bio-digital interface, and expanding the Whitepaper with **Commercial Applications**.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> The "Consciousness Monitor" is a speculative feature based on Integrated Information Theory (IIT). It will visualize a calculated "Phi" value derived from the neural network's complexity and synchrony.

## Proposed Changes

### [Simulation]
#### [MODIFY] [project_1x4g_simulation.html](file:///C:/Users/kai99/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b02c5aba-23ad-4174-8b3d-70f1bc124898/project_1x4g_simulation.html)
- **Add Component:** "Consciousness Monitor" panel.
- **Add Logic:** Calculate a simplified `Phi` metric (Integrated Information) based on:
    - `Network Synchrony` (variance of spike rates).
    - `Complexity` (entropy of GRN states).
- **Visualization:** A real-time graph showing `Phi` fluctuations, with alerts if it crosses a "Sentience Threshold".

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- None (Markdown and HTML changes).

### Manual Verification
- **Simulation:** Run the simulation and verify the "Consciousness Monitor" graph updates and reacts to system state (e.g., sleep, viral injection).
- **Artifacts:** Review the new markdown files for completeness and formatting.
