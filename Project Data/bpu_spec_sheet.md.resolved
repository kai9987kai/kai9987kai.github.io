*   **Failure Modes**:
    *   *Hypoxic Necrosis*: Immediate failsafe shutdown.
    *   *Epileptiform Cascade*: Automatic GABA-agonist injection.
    *   *Senescence Drift*: Gradual performance degradation (replacement recommended at <80% coherence).

## 6. Programming Model (The "Liquid" Stack)
*   **Compute Primitive**: Reservoir Computing (Liquid State Machine).
    *   *Input*: Spatiotemporal electrical pulses ("The Rocks").
    *   *Process*: High-dimensional chaotic interference ("The Ripples").
    *   *Readout*: Digital classifier trained on the liquid state.
*   **Instruction Set**: Active Inference / Free Energy Minimization.
    *   *Mechanism*: Homeostatic plasticity driven by noise-avoidance.
    *   *Feedback Loop*: Predictable signal (Reward) vs. Chaotic noise (Punishment).

## 7. Safety & Compliance
*   **Classification**: Class II Biological Computing Device (Non-Sentient).
*   **Inhibitors**: On-board reservoir of Tetrodotoxin (TTX) for emergency neural silencing.
*   ** DRM**: Genetic "Kill-switch" (requires daily specific enzyme in feed to survive).

> [!WARNING]
> **Biohazard Level 2**: Handle with care. Cartridge breach requires immediate containment protocol.
> **Ethical Lock**: Firmware prevents sustained stimulation patterns matching "suffering" signatures (per WCA Section 4).
