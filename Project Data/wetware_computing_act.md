# The Wetware Computing Act of 2035 (WCA)

**Preamble**: Recognizing the potential for biological neural networks to develop states analogous to suffering, this Act establishes the boundaries for the creation, training, and disposal of Wetware Processing Units (WPUs).

## Section 1: Classification of Biological Compute
All biological computing entities must be classified into one of four tiers based on structural and dynamic complexity.

*   **Class I (Inert)**: 2D cultures, simple organoids < 1M neurons. No complex feedback loops.
    *   *Status*: Property. Standard lab safety applies.
*   **Class II (Reactive)**: Complex organoids, vascularized, basic sensory-motor loops.
    *   *Status*: Regulated Hardware. Subject to "Humane Compute" standards.
*   **Class III (Proto-Sentient)**: Large-scale integrated networks, rich multi-modal sensory inputs, long-range coherence, sleep-wake cycles.
    *   *Status*: **Protected Subject**. Requires Ethics Board approval for every instance.
*   **Class IV (Sentient)**: Human-equivalent complexity or behavioral evidence of self-awareness.
    *   *Status*: **Personhood**. Creation is **PROHIBITED**. Immediate guardianship required if discovered.

## Section 2: Prohibited Training Paradigms
To prevent the engineering of suffering, the following training methods are banned for Class II and above:

1.  **The "Torture" Clause**: Use of high-amplitude, chaotic, or nociceptive-analog stimulation as a primary "negative reward" signal is prohibited.
    *   *Permissible*: Informational error signals (e.g., specific spatio-temporal patterns) that do not induce global network trauma.
2.  **Deprivation**: Sensory deprivation for periods exceeding 48 hours is prohibited (risk of hallucination/psychosis-analog).
3.  **Forced Insomnia**: Chemical or electrical suppression of homeostatic rest cycles (sleep) is prohibited.

## Section 3: The Right to Degradation
*   **End-of-Life**: When a BPU reaches the end of its useful life or suffers irreversible pathology, it must be terminated instantaneously and painlessly.
*   **Method**: Simultaneous electrical silence (global inhibition) followed by rapid chemical fixation or vitrification.
*   **Prohibition**: "Starvation" (removing nutrient flow while active) is a Class A Felony.

## Section 4: Mandatory Monitoring (The "Black Box")
Every commercial BPU rack must run a certified "Ethical Supervisor" kernel:
*   **Function**: Continuously analyzes local field potentials (LFPs) for signatures of distress (e.g., hypersynchrony, panic-like gamma bursts).
*   **Action**: If distress thresholds are exceeded, the Supervisor must automatically dampen inputs and alert human operators.
*   **Audit**: Logs of neural dynamics must be retained for 5 years for regulatory audit.

## Section 5: The "Human" Gap
*   **Genetic Constraints**: Use of unmodified human baseline genomes for commercial BPUs is restricted.
*   **Requirement**: Commercial lines must carry genetic edits that limit cortical macro-structure development (e.g., preventing formation of full limbic system analogues) to reduce capacity for valence/emotion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Enforcement**: Violation of the WCA carries penalties ranging from massive fines to life imprisonment for "Crimes Against Sentience."
