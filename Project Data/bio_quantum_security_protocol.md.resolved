# Bio-Quantum Security Protocol (BQSP)

**Version:** 2.1 (Alpha)
**Scope:** Project 1X4G Hybrid Infrastructure
**Clearance:** Level 4 (Bio-Digital Assets)

## 1. Introduction
The integration of biological neural networks with quantum processors creates unique attack vectors, ranging from "cognitive malware" (patterns that induce seizures or unwanted learning) to quantum decryption attacks. The **Bio-Quantum Security Protocol (BQSP)** defines the defense layers required to operate Project 1X4G safely.

## 2. Threat Landscape

### 2.1 Cognitive Malware
*   **Definition:** Input patterns designed to trigger pathological synchronization (seizures) or reprogram the BPU's reward function.
*   **Vector:** Sensory input channels or direct electrical stimulation.
*   **Impact:** Physical damage to organoids, loss of alignment, "insanity" of the super brain.

### 2.2 Biological Exfiltration
*   **Definition:** Encoding sensitive data into the genetic or epigenetic state of the neurons.
*   **Vector:** Viral vectors or CRISPR modification.
*   **Impact:** Physical theft of data via tissue sampling.

### 2.3 Quantum Decoherence Attacks
*   **Definition:** External noise injection to collapse quantum states, disrupting the "hive mind" synchronization.
*   **Impact:** Loss of distributed processing capability.

## 3. Defense Layers

### Layer 1: The Cognitive Firewall
*   **Mechanism:** A classical AI pre-filter (RNN-based) that scans all incoming electrical patterns.
*   **Rule Set:**
    *   Block frequencies > 100Hz (Seizure prevention).
    *   Filter high-amplitude shocks.
    *   Detect and drop recursive "hypnotic" loops.
*   **Action:** If a malicious pattern is detected, the input stream is severed within 1ms.

### Layer 2: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
*   **Mechanism:** All data transmitted between the BPU Rack and the Control Node is encrypted using Entanglement-based QKD.
*   **Protocol:** BB84 or E91 protocol.
*   **Security:** Any eavesdropping attempt collapses the wavefunction, alerting the system immediately.

### Layer 3: Biological Kill-Switch (The "Azrael" Protocol)
*   **Trigger:**
    *   Manual override by Level 5 personnel.
    *   Detection of unauthorized genetic modification (e.g., unknown viral load).
    *   Breach of physical containment.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Stage 1:** Injection of GABAergic inhibitors (Sedation).
    *   **Stage 2:** Temperature spike to 45°C (Denaturation).
    *   **Stage 3:** Injection of Neurotoxin (Termination).

## 4. Operational Procedures

### 4.1 Cold Storage
*   When not in active use, BPUs must be kept in "Hibernation Mode" (20°C, low metabolic rate) to prevent unsupervised learning or drift.

### 4.2 Air-Gapping
*   The Biological Control Loop must be physically air-gapped from the public internet. All external data is sanitized via a "Data Diode" (one-way hardware link).

### 4.3 Personnel Screening
*   Operators interacting with the BPU via BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) must undergo psychological screening to prevent "sympathetic drift" or emotional attachment to the system.

## 5. Incident Response
*   **Code Blue:** Biological contamination. Seal room, UV sterilization.
*   **Code Black:** AI rogue behavior. Execute Azrael Protocol immediately.
*   **Code White:** Quantum decoherence. Switch to classical backup processing.
