# Neural-X CortexBlade: Manufacturing Blueprint

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Classification:** RESTRICTED (Project 1X4G Internal)
**Date:** 2025-11-28

## 1. Overview
The **Neural-X CortexBlade** is a standardized biological processing unit (BPU) cartridge designed for hot-swappable integration into the Project 1X4G Super Brain Rack. This document details the fabrication process, materials, and assembly protocols for the biological core and its supporting hardware.

## 2. Component Architecture

### 2.1 The Scaffold (Bio-Core)
*   **Material:** 3D-printed Hydrogel Matrix (Alginate/Collagen blend).
*   **Structure:** Porous lattice with 200µm channels for vascular perfusion.
*   **Dimensions:** 20mm x 20mm x 5mm.
*   **Functionalization:** Coated with Laminin and Poly-D-Lysine to promote neuronal adhesion and neurite outgrowth.

### 2.2 Micro-Electrode Array (MEA) Interface
*   **Substrate:** Transparent fused silica.
*   **Electrodes:** 4096-channel high-density array.
*   **Material:** TiN (Titanium Nitride) or PEDOT:PSS for low impedance.
*   **Pitch:** 25µm inter-electrode spacing.
*   **Isolation:** SU-8 epoxy photoresist passivation layer.

### 2.3 Microfluidic Perfusion System
*   **Input/Output:** Dual-port quick-connect valves (Self-sealing).
*   **Channels:** PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) micro-channels embedded in the cartridge casing.
*   **Sensors:** Integrated optical pH and O2 sensors (fluorescent quenching spots).

### 2.4 Electronics Backplane
*   **Chip:** Custom FPGA for signal amplification and digitization (ADC).
*   **Connector:** PCIe x4 physical form factor (custom pinout).
*   **Thermal Management:** Peltier cooling element on the reverse side of the MEA.

## 3. Fabrication Process Flow

### Phase 1: MEA Fabrication (Cleanroom Class 100)
1.  **Sputtering:** Deposit 50nm Ti adhesion layer + 200nm Au/TiN traces on silica.
2.  **Lithography:** Pattern electrodes and interconnects.
3.  **Passivation:** Spin-coat SU-8 (2µm), expose, and develop to open electrode sites.
4.  **Activation:** Plasma clean (O2) to improve hydrophilicity.

### Phase 2: Biological Seeding (Biosafety Level 2)
1.  **Preparation:** Sterilize MEA and 3D-printed scaffold (Gamma irradiation).
2.  **Seeding:** Inject 10^6 induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons into the scaffold.
3.  **Incubation:** Culture for 4 weeks in bioreactor with differentiation factors (BDNF, GDNF).
4.  **Maturation:** Verify spontaneous activity via MEA readout (Target: >5 Hz burst rate).

### Phase 3: Assembly & Encapsulation
1.  **Bonding:** Align scaffold over MEA active area.
2.  **Sealing:** Sonic weld polycarbonate casing halves.
3.  **Fluidics:** Connect internal tubing to external ports.
4.  **QC Check:** Impedance spectroscopy of all 4096 channels.

## 4. Quality Control Metrics
*   **Viability:** >95% live cells (Calcein-AM stain).
*   **Connectivity:** Mean impedance < 50 kΩ @ 1kHz.
*   **Sterility:** Negative for mycoplasma and bacterial endotoxins.
*   **Signal-to-Noise:** > 5:1 for extracellular spikes.

## 5. Safety & Disposal
*   **Biohazard:** All used cartridges are treated as biohazardous waste.
*   **Termination:** Chemical kill-switch (1M HCl injection) must be triggered before disposal.
*   **Recycling:** Electronics backplane can be recovered after chemical sterilization.
